## Welcome to my options tool

This website will describe my process during the construction of my options tool with the relevant source code at each stage.

### About
This tool was created with the intention of having one central tool allowing me to remind myself of different option strategies and to be able to visualise them in comparison with each other. 

#### Put and Call formulas

The project started as all options projects do - coding the formula for a call and a put given by the Black-Scholes model.
Below is the code I used to code the call and puts - this was fairly simple. The greatest difficulties came in deciding how to price American-Style puts.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HaseebAsad/OptionsProject/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
